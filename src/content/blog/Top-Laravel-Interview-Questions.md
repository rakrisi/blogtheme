3.  **Explain the directory structure of a Laravel application.**

    - A typical Laravel application has directories for controllers, models, views, routes, configuration, migrations, and more. These directories are organized to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

4.  **What is Composer, and why is it important in Laravel?**

    - Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. In Laravel, it is crucial for managing project dependencies, including Laravel itself and third-party packages. It simplifies package installation and version control.

5.  **How do you create a new Laravel project?**

    - To create a new Laravel project, you use the Composer command: `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name`.

6.  **What is the purpose of the .env file in Laravel?**

    - The .env file stores configuration settings for your Laravel application, such as database credentials, app environment, and API keys. It allows for easy configuration without modifying source code.

7.  **What is routing in Laravel?**

    - Routing defines how HTTP requests are mapped to application logic. It determines which controller method should handle a specific URL.

8.  **How do you create a basic route in Laravel?**

    - You can define a basic route in the `routes/web.php` file using the `Route::get()` or `Route::post()` methods, specifying the URL and the controller method to be executed.

9.  **What are controllers, and how are they used in Laravel?**

    - Controllers handle the application's HTTP requests. They contain methods that respond to specific routes, perform actions, and return views or data.

10. **How do you pass data from a controller to a view?**

    - Data can be passed from a controller to a view using an associative array with the return view('view-name', ['key' => 'value'])` method. In the view, you can access this data using Blade templating.

11. **What is Blade templating in Laravel?**

    - Blade is Laravel's templating engine, which provides a simple and expressive syntax for writing views and templates. It allows you to include logic and data within your views.

12. **How can you validate form data in Laravel?**
